## Restaurants

This repo is a reference for implementing the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) design pattern. This is a widely implemented pattern that you see in lots of different languages. This pattern enables the abstracting away of the database layer, so you can swap out a MySql DB for a Postgres or an Sqlite3.

The model is simple Restaurant has many Menu and they have many Item.
